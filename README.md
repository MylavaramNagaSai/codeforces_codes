# My Codeforces Solutions

This repository is a personal archive of all my accepted solutions from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).

I use this to track my progress in competitive programming, review past problems, and keep all my work organized in one place.

## ðŸ¤– Automation

All solutions in this repository are **automatically committed and pushed** as soon as they are accepted on Codeforces.

This is done using the [CFPusher](https://github.com/SarJ2004/cf-pusher) browser extension, which allows me to focus on solving problems without worrying about manual uploads.
